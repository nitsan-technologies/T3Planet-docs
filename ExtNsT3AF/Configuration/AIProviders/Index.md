Providers represent connections to AI services. Each provider stores an adapter
type, optional endpoint, encrypted credentials, models, and capability flags.

**Path:** AI Foundation > AI Providers

Use the interactive walkthrough above, then continue with the details below.

![AI Providers list with configured vendors, models, status, and actions](./images/provider-01.webp)

AI Providers list — configured adapters, models, connection status, and
default provider.

Without at least one working provider, no AI feature runs.

Alternatively, use [AI Credits](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/T3Planet-Credit-System/Index) when you want AI without configuring your own vendor API keys. Your Own API Keys stays the default.

## Adding a provider

1. Open AI Foundation > AI Providers.
2. Click Add provider.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Display name** — Friendly label for your team (for example `OpenAI
   production`).
   - **Adapter type** — Vendor protocol (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure,
   Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Ollama, or custom OpenAI-compatible).
   - **API key** — Cloud vendors need a key. Leave empty for local Ollama.
   - **Model ID** — Completion model (for example `gpt-4o-mini`).
4. Optionally set the endpoint URL, embedding model, capabilities, temperature,
and pricing fields.
5. Click Save.
6. Enable Default on exactly one provider.

<Tip>
For first-time setup, use Quick Setup in the AI Foundation module
header. It walks through provider creation with fewer decisions.
</Tip>

Edit AI Provider — adapter type, API key, chat model, and capability flags.

## Testing a connection

After saving a provider, click Test connection to verify the setup.
The test calls the provider API and reports:

- Connection status (success or failure)
- Error details on failure
- Model / capability hints when the adapter can list them

<Note>
Self-hosted endpoints (such as Ollama) must be reachable from the TYPO3
server. Typical causes of a failed test:

- Wrong host or port in Endpoint URL (default
`http://localhost:11434` for Ollama)
- Docker/network isolation between PHP and the model host
- Outbound HTTPS blocked for cloud vendors

Local adapters usually do not need an API key. Cloud adapters do.
</Note>

If your server reaches the internet only through a corporate proxy, configure
TYPO3 HTTP settings:

config/system/additional.php

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['HTTP']['proxy'] = 'http://proxy.example.com:8080';
```

## Editing and deleting providers

- Click a provider row to edit its settings in the drawer.
- Use Test connection after rotating an API key or changing the
model.
- Use Delete to remove a provider. Features that pointed at that
provider fall back to the global default (or fail until another provider is
assigned).

<Warning>
Deleting the only default provider leaves child extensions without a global
fallback. Set another provider as Default first.
</Warning>

## Supported adapters

Built-in and discovered adapters include:

- `symfony.openai` — OpenAI
- `symfony.anthropic` — Anthropic Claude
- `symfony.gemini` — Google Gemini
- `symfony.mistral` — Mistral AI
- `symfony.ollama` — Local Ollama
- `symfony.openrouter` — OpenRouter
- `nst3af.openai_compatible` — Custom / OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- Additional Symfony AI bridges when their Composer packages are installed
(for example Azure, DeepSeek, xAI)

Custom adapters: [Custom AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/DeveloperGuide/CustomProviders/Index).

## Capabilities and Their Purpose

Pick a model that supports what you need. Test connection helps
validate the choice.

| Capability | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chat` | Normal text generation: SEO, Pages, Content, News, LLM translation, chatbot answers. This is the main flag for message-style APIs, and every `complete()` request is allowed when it is ticked. |
| `completion` | Legacy/raw text completion. AI Foundation treats it as equivalent to `chat`: either one is enough for the `complete()` path, and text features are blocked only when both are unticked. |
| `embeddings` | Only for `embed()`, which turns text into vectors for semantic search, RAG and similarity matching. It has no effect on normal text generation, and an embedding model should also be set on the provider. |
| `vision` | Only needed when a request includes images (for example alt-text generation or image description). Text-only requests do not need it, but requests with images are blocked without it. |
| `streaming` | Only for `stream()`, where the answer arrives piece by piece (for example a live chatbot). Without it, streaming calls are blocked, but normal `complete()` requests still work. |
| `tts` | Only for text-to-speech: converting text into audio (for example audio for content elements). It is always checked strictly and must be ticked explicitly. |
| `image_generation` | Only for creating images from a text prompt (for example the T3AI image generator). It is always checked strictly and must be ticked explicitly. |

## Multiple providers — when and why

**Dev and live** — Separate rows with different API keys per environment.

**Cost saving** — Cheap model as global default; premium model assigned in
[AI Features](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIFeatures/Index) for important tasks.

**EU hosting** — Mistral or Azure in an EU region for data residency
requirements.

## Provider fields

Fields below map to the AI Providers drawer and the
`tx_nst3af_provider` table.

### Required

<ResponseField name="identifier" type="string" required>
Unique slug for programmatic access (for example `openai-prod`,
`ollama-local`). Must be unique.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
Display name shown in the backend and dropdowns.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="adapter_type" type="string" required>
Adapter protocol identifier, for example `symfony.openai` or
`nst3af.openai_compatible`.
</ResponseField>

### Connection

<ResponseField name="api_key" type="string">
API key for authentication. Stored as sodium ciphertext with an
`enc:v1:` prefix — raw keys are never kept in the database. Required for
cloud adapters; usually empty for local Ollama.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint_url" type="string" default="Adapter default">
Custom API base URL. Required for OpenAI-compatible and Ollama-style
adapters when the default host is wrong for your network.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="model_id" type="string">
Default completion / chat model ID.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="embedding_model_id" type="string">
Default embedding model ID when embeddings are enabled.
</ResponseField>

### Optional configuration

<ResponseField name="capabilities" type="string list" required>
Enabled capabilities: `chat`, `completion`, `embeddings`, `vision`,
`streaming`, `tts`, `image_generation`. See
[Capabilities and Their Purpose](#capabilities-and-their-purpose).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float" default="0.7">
Default sampling temperature (`0.0`–`2.0`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="system_prompt" type="text">
Optional provider-level system message prepended to requests.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_default" type="bool" default="false">
Mark as the global default. Keep exactly one default among enabled rows.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="is_enabled" type="bool" default="true">
Soft on/off switch without deleting the row.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="priority" type="integer" default="50">
Ordering hint (`0`–`100`) when multiple providers are listed.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="be_groups" type="backend groups">
Restrict this provider to selected backend groups. Empty means available to
all groups.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="privacy_level" type="string" default="standard">
Logging privacy only — how much is stored in the local request log
(`standard`, `reduced` without prompt fingerprint, or `none`). This
does not redact or block prompts, brand context, or documents sent to the
AI provider.
</ResponseField>

## Troubleshooting

**Test fails** — Check the API key, model ID, endpoint URL, and outbound
HTTPS/firewall rules.

**Rate limit** — Wait or upgrade the vendor plan.

**Vision returns empty** — Use a vision-capable model (for example GPT-4o with
vision).

**Module works but child extension fails** — Check
[AI Features](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIFeatures/Index) for per-task overrides.

## Security

- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Use one key per environment (dev, staging, live)
- Restrict access via [AI Permissions](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIPermissions/Index)
- Never commit API keys to Git
