Verified issues and checks for **T3AF** (`EXT:ns_t3af`).

## Installation

**Composer conflicts with another MCP package**

T3AF includes an MCP server and conflicts with other MCP server packages such as `marekskopal/typo3-mcp-server` and `hn/typo3-mcp-server`. Remove those packages before installing `nitsan/ns-t3af`.

**Backend module is missing**

1. Confirm `ns_t3af` is active.
2. Flush all caches.
3. Run:

  ```bash
  ./vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup
  ./vendor/bin/typo3 cache:flush
  ```

Also confirm `scheduler` and `workspaces` are available. See [Installation](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Installation/Index).

## Providers

**Provider request or Test connection fails**

- Confirm the provider row exists and is **enabled** in T3AF > AI Providers.
- Run **Test connection** from the provider drawer.
- Check the API key, model ID, and endpoint URL (for custom/OpenAI-compatible rows).
- Confirm outbound HTTPS to the provider API works from the server.
- Review backend logs for entries from T3AF request logging.

**Unexpected model or provider behavior**

- Confirm the **default** provider matches the feature you expect.
- Confirm the model ID on the provider row.
- Check feature-level provider overrides in T3AF > AI Features.

**No usage statistics shown**

- Confirm an OpenAI admin/organization key is set where org usage charts are required.
- Clear caches and open T3AF > AI Usage / T3AF > AI Logs again.
- Confirm the dashboard analytics cache is available after `extension:setup`.

## Configuration

**HTTP 401 / 403 when fetching a protected URL**

If you use the Basic Auth helper in T3AF > AI Features > Access & Notifications:

- Enable `basicAuthEnabled`.
- Set `basicAuthUsername` and `basicAuthPassword`.
- Retry the protected URL fetch.

## MCP

**MCP client cannot connect**

- Confirm the MCP server is enabled in T3AF > MCP Server > Advanced.
- Prefer HTTPS on the site base URL.
- For Cursor and similar clients, follow [MCP Testing](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Integrations/MCPTesting/Index).
- For stdio setups, keep the working directory and user/workspace flags correct.

**MCP writes fail after a successful connect**

Confirm the backend user has the required module, table, and workspace rights. See [AI Permissions](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIPermissions/Index).

## Report an issue

Include TYPO3 version, PHP version, `ns_t3af` version, exact error text, and whether MCP is enabled. Submit via [Support](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Support/Index).
