## Purpose


<div className="t3-embed"><iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmrbp5q660ej4qmo546ztyk1h?utm_source=link" loading="lazy" title="T3AF MCP Server Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" frameBorder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
Connect external AI agents to TYPO3 through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Tools like **Cursor**, **Claude Desktop**, and **n8n** can read pages, inspect schema, and update records (with permissions).

**Path:** T3AF > MCP Server

Follow this interactive walkthrough, then continue with the details below.

MCP Server — online status, connection methods, and Remote OAuth endpoint details.

## What MCP does

- Read TYPO3 pages and content
- Inspect database schema
- Create or update records (with permissions)
- Call extension-registered tools (see [MCP Tools](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Integrations/MCPTools/Index))

## Enable MCP

1. Open T3AF > MCP Server > Advanced.
2. Enable the MCP server checkbox (`enableMcpServer`).
3. Flush caches → status should show **Online**.

The setting is also available in T3AF extension settings under the **MCP Server** group. It is not part of the classic TYPO3 Admin Tools > Settings > Extension Configuration form.

## Health check

MCP endpoint health check
```
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://your-site.com/mcp
# Expect: 401 (auth required = good)
```

OAuth discovery endpoint
```
curl -sS https://your-site.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp
# Expect: JSON 200
```

## Connection methods

- **Remote OAuth** — Production and Cursor. Uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE.
- **mcp-remote** — Simple HTTP clients. Uses URL token.
- **Local CLI** — DDEV and local development. Uses backend user and workspace.

## MCP modes

Set the mode in the **MCP Server** top bar (stored as `mcpMode` in the T3AF MCP settings).

**Context (AI Generate via AI Agent)** — Default for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and similar clients.

- The external AI agent generates content outside TYPO3.
- MCP tools apply and save that content into TYPO3 (pages, records, files).
- Use this when the model and reasoning run in the client, and TYPO3 is the CMS tool layer.

**Native (AI Generate via TYPO3)** — Server-side generation.

- TYPO3 runs AI generation on the server through your configured [AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIProviders/Index).
- MCP tools receive instructions and generate or process content inside TYPO3.
- Use this when generation must stay on your instance (provider keys, brand context, and governance already configured in T3AF).

Some dual-mode content tools change their argument requirements and descriptions based on the active mode. After switching mode, reconnect or refresh your MCP client so the tool list updates.

## Core tools

T3AF ships a large **TYPO3 Core** tool catalog (pages, content, records, files, workspaces, scheduler, permissions, redirects, cache, and more). Browse the full list in T3AF > MCP Tools.

Starter examples for first checks:

- `table_schema` — Field metadata for any table
- `pages_get` — Read one page
- `content_list` — List content on a page
- `write_table` — Create, update, or delete records

Child extensions can register additional tools — also visible in the **MCP Tools** tab.

## Workspaces

- **0** — Live workspace
- **1+** — Draft workspace

MCP edits respect the active workspace. Test writes in workspace `1` before live.

## Cursor example (stdio / DDEV)

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "typo3": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["-lc", "cd /path/to/project && ddev exec php vendor/bin/typo3 ns_t3af:mcp:serve --no-startup-message -u admin -w 0"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

- Use **HTTPS** in production
- Treat URL tokens like passwords
- Limit which backend users can authorize OAuth
- Test in draft workspace before live writes
- Enable [AI Permissions](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIPermissions/Index) for multi-user sites

## When to enable MCP

- Developers use Cursor or Claude Desktop with TYPO3 daily
- Automation workflows via n8n need CMS access
- Staging environment for safe agent testing

## When not to enable yet

- Production site without HTTPS
- No clear policy for which admins may authorize agents
- Team has not completed [AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIProviders/Index) setup
