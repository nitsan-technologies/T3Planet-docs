Monitor credit balance on the Dashboard and verify Credits traffic in AI Usage.

## Dashboard

**Path:** AI Foundation > Dashboard

![AI Foundation Dashboard in AI Credits mode with balance, credit burn chart, and spend by extension](images/t3planet-credits-dashboard.webp)

Credits Dashboard — remaining balance, credit burn over time, spend by
extension, and period KPIs.

### What it shows

- **Credit balance** — remaining credits from T3Planet
- **Usage charts** — credit use and requests for the selected period
- **KPI cards** — requests, tokens, credits used, success rate
- **Recent requests** — the latest AI requests from the local request log
for the current period filter (not a fixed “last hour” window). See
[AI Usage](#ai-usage) below for the full
filterable history.

<Tip>
Remaining balance comes from T3Planet. Local charts and recent requests come
from the request log. They are related, but not always identical.
</Tip>

### Period filter

Use Today, Yesterday, 7 / 14 / 30 days, or a custom range. Charts, KPIs, and
the recent-requests list follow this filter.

## AI Usage

**Path:** AI Foundation > AI Usage

Use AI Usage to confirm that AI calls ran through AI Credits and to
inspect individual requests.

### What to look for

For Credits traffic, the **provider** value is:

`t3planet_credits`

### Column glossary

- **Module / extension** — which product triggered the call (for example
T3 AI, AI Search, AI Chatbot)
- **Model** — model used for that request
- **Tokens** — input and output token count
- **Credits** — credits charged for a successful Credits request
- **Status** — success or error for that call
- **Provider** — `t3planet_credits` when Credits handled the request;
otherwise your own API provider id

### Filter and search

In AI Usage, narrow the log by:

- **Date range** — same period idea as the Dashboard (today, last N days,
or custom)
- **Provider** — filter to `t3planet_credits` to see only Credits traffic
- **Status** — success vs failed/error rows
- **Module / extension** — when you need traffic from one product only

Use these filters when the recent list on the Dashboard is not enough.

### How to verify Credits

1. Activate Credits.
2. Run one AI action that uses AI Foundation — for example, generate a meta
description in **T3 AI**.
3. Open AI Usage.
4. Filter by provider `t3planet_credits` (or scan the latest rows).
5. Confirm a new row for that action.

From Dashboard, open a recent request or go to AI Usage when you
need filters, older history, or failed-request details.
