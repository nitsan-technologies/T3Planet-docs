</Note>

## After activation

When Credits is active:

- Billable AI calls go through T3Planet and use your credit balance
- Usage is logged in AI Usage as `t3planet_credits`
- Credits panels appear and the own provider list is hidden
- Balance is available on the Dashboard and Credits panel
- Switching back to Your Own API Keys restores your saved providers

## Group limits

Set per-group usage caps in AI Foundation > AI Permissions.

1. Open AI Permissions.
2. Select the backend usergroup.
3. Configure credit-related limits for that group.

What can be capped:

- **Monthly credit limit** — Maximum credits the group may use per month
- **Daily request limit** — Maximum AI requests the group may send per day

Administrator users are exempt from these caps.

## Buy more credits

When your balance is low, open Buy more credits on the Credits
panel or Dashboard. You complete purchase on the T3Planet checkout page;
invoices stay in your T3Planet account.

<Warning>
If T3Planet returns a rate-limit message, wait for the shown cooldown before
retrying.
