## Overview

T3AI now runs as a child extension of AI Foundation (`ns_t3af`).
If you used T3AI before the new architecture, this guide helps you move your existing setup to the shared AI Foundation model.

## Previous Version

Earlier T3AI projects usually followed a simpler setup:

1. Install T3AI directly
2. Configure the provider inside the child-extension flow
3. Start using page, content, SEO, translation, or media features

## New Architecture

T3AI now depends on AI Foundation for shared providers, authentication, AI features, prompts, and core services.
T3AI continues to provide the editor-facing workflows, but the shared AI setup now belongs to the parent extension.

## Before Updating

Before you update, make sure you:

- back up your files and database
- test the update on staging first
- check that your TYPO3 and PHP versions are still supported
- install or update AI Foundation
- prepare access to the AI provider credentials used by your project

Review these pages before you start:

- [AI Foundation Installation](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Installation/Index)
- [AI Foundation Configuration](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/Index)
- [AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIProviders/Index)

## Migration Steps

1. Back up the TYPO3 project.
2. Install or update AI Foundation (`ns_t3af`).
3. Configure the provider and model setup in AI Foundation.
4. Verify that AI Foundation is active and can complete one test request.
5. Install or update T3AI.
6. Run the Database Analyzer and apply pending changes.
7. Clear TYPO3 caches.
8. Review T3AI prompts and feature settings if your project uses custom output rules.
9. Test one workflow from each important area you use, such as page generation, SEO, translation, or media.

## What to do after updating

After the update, confirm that:

- T3AI opens correctly in the TYPO3 backend
- the shared provider from AI Foundation is available
- prompts still produce the expected writing style
- page, SEO, translation, or media workflows still return usable results
- logs do not show unexpected provider or request errors

## Recommended Post-Update Checks

- Run one page or content generation test
- Test one SEO action if your project uses SEO automation
- Test one translation or media action if those modules are in use
- Review [AI Logs](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AI/AISettings/Index#ai-logs) for failures
- Re-check [AI Prompts](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AI/Prompts/Index) if the wording changed after migration

## Common Migration Issues

- **AI Foundation is missing**: install `ns_t3af` before updating T3AI.
- **No provider is available**: complete the shared provider setup in AI Foundation.
- **Generated results look different**: review prompt rules and feature settings after the migration.
- **Modules open but requests fail**: clear caches and check the provider credentials again.
