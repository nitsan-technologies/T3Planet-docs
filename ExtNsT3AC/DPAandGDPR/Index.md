This page answers GDPR-related questions about visitor chatbot data and describes **technical data-management capabilities** in T3AC.

## Save Chatbot History

T3AC allows administrators to control whether visitor chatbot history is stored.

The **Save chatbot history** option is available under the AI Chatbot configuration. For this setting, see [Save chatbot history](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AC/FeatureGuide/Chatbot/Index#t3ac-save-chatbot-history).

### Backend steps

1. Open **AI Chatbot** in the TYPO3 backend.
2. Click the **Chatbot** tab.
3. In **Settings**, enable or disable **Save chatbot history**.

**When enabled**, T3AC can store chatbot-related history such as visitor conversations and generated answers.

**When disabled:**

- New chatbot conversations and answers are **not** stored as durable chatbot history.
- Past-chat reopen is not retained for new conversations.
- Thumbs-up/down feedback is hidden.
- Live chat still works. The current session is kept only in a short-lived server cache (`ns_t3ac_ephemeral_chat`, about **24 hours**), not as a durable TYPO3 log.

Disabling chatbot history affects **newly generated** chatbot and feedback data. Existing records are not automatically removed. Use the history cleanup scheduler to remove previously stored records. See [History cleanup](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AC/FeatureGuide/DataSource/Index#t3as-history-cleanup).

```bash
vendor/bin/typo3 t3af:history:cleanup
vendor/bin/typo3 t3af:history:cleanup 30
```

The first command uses the default retention of **90** days. Passing a number (for example `30`) deletes usage history older than that many days.

## Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Considerations

Administrators should consider and document:

- Visitor chatbot data storage (messages, session metadata, visitor history)
- Identifiers: hashed IP (MD5) and browser visitor id — treat hashed IP as **pseudonymised personal data**, not anonymous data
- Browser `localStorage` key `chat_user_id` (still created for live chat when history is off)
- Ephemeral live-session cache (~24 hours) when history is off
- Rate limiting may hash the client IP independently of the history toggle
- Data retention and deletion
- Data sent to the AI provider (messages + RAG context; not IP/UA/cookies in the LLM payload)
- BYOK vs AI Credits — see [AI Credits](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/T3Planet-Credit-System/Index)
- Provider DPA / no model training

## Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Questions

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Does T3AC process frontend visitor information? | **Yes**, when a visitor uses the chatbot. T3AC can store conversation text, a hashed IP, and a browser visitor id. It does **not** store a frontend-user (`fe_user`) ID or cookies as database fields. |
| Does T3AC store visitor conversations? | **Yes — when Save chatbot history is on (the default).** See tables below. |
| Can visitor logging be disabled while keeping the chatbot? | **Yes.** Turn **Save chatbot history** off. When off: new chats are not written to the three history tables; the Chatbot card in Usage Analytics is hidden; thumbs and past-chat reopen are hidden; live chat uses ephemeral cache (~24 hours); `chat_user_id` is still created for the live session. Existing rows stay until deleted or purged. See [Usage Analytics](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AC/FeatureGuide/UsageAnalytics/Index). |
| What is sent to the AI provider? | Visitor messages plus required RAG / context and system instructions. **Not sent** in the T3AC / AI Foundation payload: visitor IP, User-Agent, session ID, cookies, or the browser visitor id. |
| How long are records retained? | Until they are deleted — manually in Usage Analytics, or by `t3af:history:cleanup` when a Scheduler task is set up. There is no hard expiry on each row by itself. |
| Logging via AI Foundation? | Separate from T3AC history. AI Usage stores a **SHA-256 prompt fingerprint**, tokens, and timing — not the full conversation. Privacy level can reduce or stop AI Usage rows; it does **not** stop T3AC history. See [AI Usage & Logs](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIUsageAndLogs/Index) and [AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIProviders/Index) (privacy level). |
| Does T3AC use conversations to train foundation models? | **No.** Whether a vendor trains on API data is governed by the provider contract / DPA, not by a switch inside T3AC. |
| MCP? | If AI Foundation MCP is enabled, T3AC tools can run chatbot operations through connected clients. That is backend/editor access, not public-visitor processing. Restrict MCP as an access-control topic. See [MCP Server](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Integrations/MCPServer/Index). |

### Conversation storage tables

| Table | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `tx_nst3ac_domain_model_chatbot_chat` | Session metadata |
| `tx_nst3ac_domain_model_chatbot_messages` | Visitor messages and AI replies; optional feedback |
| `tx_nst3ac_domain_model_chatbot_history` | Links a visitor to a chatbot session |

### Which identifiers are stored?

| Data | Stored? | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full chat messages | **Yes** | When history is on |
| IP address | **Hashed (MD5)** | Not stored as plain IP. Still treat as personal data. |
| Browser visitor id | **Yes** | Created in the browser (`localStorage` `chat_user_id`) and sent to the server |
| Frontend user (`fe_user`) | **No** | — |
| Cookies as DB fields | **No** | Browser local storage is used for the visitor id |

### Are there other places that still store visitor data?

| Place | What is stored |
| --- | --- |
| Browser local storage (`chat_user_id`) | Random visitor id, also when history is off |
| Ephemeral cache `ns_t3ac_ephemeral_chat` | Current live session only (~24 hours) when history is off |
| Rate limiter cache | Hashed client IP, independent of the history toggle |
