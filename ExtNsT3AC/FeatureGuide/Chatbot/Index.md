## Configuration

**Step 1:** Open **AI Chatbot** in the TYPO3 backend.

**Step 2:** Click the **Chatbot** tab.

**Step 3:** Enable the chatbot, then configure feedback, **Save chatbot history**, messages, and instructions.

### Settings {#t3ac-save-chatbot-history}

Turn the chatbot on and control how it greets visitors and whether **Save chatbot history** is enabled.

- **Enable AI Chatbot** — Activates the chatbot on your site
- **Chatbot Feedback** — Shows thumbs up/down on responses; ratings appear in **Usage Analytics**
- **Save chatbot history** — Saves conversations for analytics and past chats. Turn this off for stricter privacy.
- **Title** — Name shown in the chatbot (e.g. AI Chatbot)
- **Short Description** — Brief text describing the assistant
- **Bubble Message** — Trigger bubble text (e.g. "Hey there, How can I help you?")
- **Welcome Message** — First message visitors see (e.g. "Hi, how can I help you?")
- **Chatbot Language** — Default language for the chatbot
- **Chatbot Instructions** — Custom rules for how the chatbot should answer

Use the live preview panel (click the chatbot avatar) to check title, messages, and appearance before you click **Save Configuration**.

## AI Prompts

Use AI Prompts when you want to refine how the chatbot greets users, answers questions, follows project-specific rules, or stays within the right tone. This is useful when different websites or teams need chatbot output to stay consistent without editing the answer manually every time.

<div className="t3-embed"><iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmrbodcvo0dj7qmo5ds4mf5m4?utm_source=link&embed_v=2&utm_source=embed" loading="lazy" title="T3AC AI Prompts Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" frameBorder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Best practices:

- Keep instructions short and easy to test.
- Use prompts to define greeting style, answer tone, and response limits.
- Test prompts with real user questions before rollout.
- Review [AI Foundation AI Prompts](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/AIPrompts/Index) when you want shared prompt behavior across multiple AI Universe extensions.

## Customization

Open the **Customize** tab to match the chatbot appearance to your website. Changes appear in the live preview panel.

- **Upload Logo** — Add your company logo to the chatbot header
- **Upload Avatar** — Set the chatbot profile image
- **Avatar Size** — Adjust the profile image size with the slider, then check the preview
- **Chatbot Color** — Choose the chatbot appearance color
- **Show Logo** — Show or hide the logo in the chatbot
- **Show Date & Time** — Display the current date and time in the chat
- **Transparent Trigger** — Make the chatbot trigger appear more discreetly on the page
- **Chatbot Position** — Reposition the widget (e.g., bottom-right)
- **Widget Bottom Space** — Set the distance from the bottom of the page (min: 15px, max: 200px)

## General

Open the **General** tab to control where the chatbot appears, whether source links are shown, and how custom CSS is applied.

### Page Visibility

Use Page Visibility to decide on which pages the chatbot is shown.

- You can show the chatbot only on selected pages.
- You can also hide it on selected pages, even when it is enabled globally.

### Show Chatbot on Specific Pages

Use this option to show the chatbot only on pages you choose.

- Enter page IDs in a comma-separated list.
- Example: `10, 22, 35`
- The chatbot will be visible on these pages.

### Hide Chatbot on Specific Pages

Use this option to hide the chatbot on specific pages.

- Enter page IDs in a comma-separated list.
- Example: `45, 60, 72`
- These pages stay hidden even if chatbot is enabled globally.

### Sources Links

Enable **Source Links** to attach reference URLs to chatbot responses based on the data used.

When enabled, the chatbot adds clickable links from indexed sources (for example TYPO3 pages or documents) used to generate the answer.

**How it works:**

- The system retrieves relevant content from configured data sources.
- The response is generated using this content.
- Source URLs are mapped and added as clickable links.

This allows users to verify information and access the original content. If disabled, no source links are shown.

### Custom Styling

Use Custom Styling to match the chatbot design with your website style.

- Add your custom CSS for colors, spacing, and font styles.
- Keep styling simple for better readability and user experience.

### Custom Internal CSS

Use this field when you want to apply CSS directly inside the chatbot widget.

Example:

```css
.chatbot-header {
  background: #your-color;
}
```

This CSS is injected inside the chatbot widget, so it affects only chatbot UI elements.

## External Embed

Use the **External Embed** tab when you want this chatbot on another site — TYPO3 or any other domain.

- Open the **External Embed** area in T3AC.
- Add the allowed domain, or enable the option that allows any approved domain policy used by your project.
- Copy the embed code.
- Paste the code inside the `<body>` tag of your website.

When you finish Configuration, Customize, General, and External Embed, click **Save Configuration** to apply the settings.

For the full setup flow, see [Configuration](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AC/Configuration/Index).

## Multilanguage

Configure your chatbot to support multiple languages directly from the **Configuration** tab by selecting the default language from the dropdown menu. Only the languages that have already been added to your domain will be available for selection.

## Basic Authentication Support

If you want to crawl URLs protected by htaccess / HTTP Basic Authentication, enable **Basic Authentication Support** and enter the username and password.

Open **T3AF → AI Features → Access & Notifications**, then enable the option and save your changes.

## Configurable Database Chunking for various types of Dataset Processing

**Overview**

- This feature provides configurable database chunking to efficiently process large datasets while maintaining optimal performance and stability. Instead of loading all records in a single query, data is fetched and processed in smaller chunks, reducing memory usage and preventing execution timeouts.
- The chunk size is configurable via the T3AF feature settings, allowing administrators to adjust it according to server capacity and dataset size.

**Default Configuration**

- By default, database chunking is enabled with a chunk size of 1000 records.
- If required, this value can be modified in **T3AF → AI Features → Training** to better suit the execution environment.
