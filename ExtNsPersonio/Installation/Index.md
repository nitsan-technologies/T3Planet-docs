## Pre-configured Speaking URLs for Job Pages

**Speaking URLs** are user-friendly, readable URLs that describe the content or purpose of a page, making navigation easier for users and enhancing SEO. For example, instead of using a complex URL like:

**Standard URL**

```python
example.com/index.php?id=123&tx_nspersonio_pi2[action]=detail&tx_nspersonio_pi2[controller]=Job&tx_nsperso...
```

**A Speaking URL would look like:**

```python
example.com/page-title/software-developer
```

### How to Enable Speaking URLs for Job Details and Application Form Pages?

To configure Speaking URLs specifically for jobs and application form pages in your TYPO3 site, add the following code to your main `config.yaml` file:

```python
imports:
  - { resource: "EXT:ns_personio/Configuration/Routes.yaml" }
```
