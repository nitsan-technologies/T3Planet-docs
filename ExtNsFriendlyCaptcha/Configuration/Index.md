## Local & Staging Testing

If you want to test this extension on a local server without an official domain or IP:

- **Recommended:** Create a free Friendly Captcha account and generate a separate **development Sitekey/Secret Key** for local/staging use.
- Do not reuse your production key on a local server. Friendly Captcha production credentials are tied to specific domains registered in your account, so a mismatched domain will cause verification to fail.
- Use your **development key** for local/staging testing and your **production key** for the live domain.
- To whitelist a development or staging domain, contact our support center: [https://t3planet.de/support](https://t3planet.de/support)
