This guide helps you install **T3AA Premium** (`EXT:ns_t3aa`) on a TYPO3 project for the first time.

T3AA needs **AI Foundation** (`EXT:ns_t3af`). AI Foundation provides AI access (AI Credits or your own API keys), models, prompts, and shared AI services. Without it, T3AA cannot run.

## Quick overview for new customers

You will install and activate these pieces:

1. **T3Planet Shop** (`EXT:ns_license`) — unlocks your Premium download
2. **T3AA** (`EXT:ns_t3aa`) — the Accessibility Assistant extension
3. **AI Foundation** (`EXT:ns_t3af`) — shared AI engine used by T3AA
4. **Database updates** — so TYPO3 creates the required tables
5. **AI access** — AI Credits or your own API keys, so T3AA can send AI requests
6. **Final check** — confirm modules load and the license is active

Follow the steps below in order. Choose **either** Non-Composer **or** Composer in Step 2 — not both.

<Warning>
If you are upgrading from an older version (**1.5.2** or earlier) to the latest release,
follow [Reinstall After Upgrading](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/ReInstallEverything/Index) instead of this installation guide.
</Warning>

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- Backend access as an administrator
- Your **T3AA license key** from T3Planet
- Decided whether your project uses **Composer** or the **TYPO3 Extension Manager**
- For Step 5: **AI Credits** (no API keys needed) or your own AI provider API key (for example OpenAI)

## Step 1 — Install the T3Planet Shop

Install the latest version of `EXT:ns_license` before continuing.

The T3Planet Shop controls access to T3Planet Premium packages and is required to download and activate T3AA.

## Step 2 — Activate the License

Pick the path that matches your project.

## Non-Composer Installation

Use this workflow when your project installs T3Planet extensions from the TYPO3 backend:

1. Open **Admin tools** → **T3Planet Shop**.
2. Enter your T3AA license key.
3. Activate the license.
4. Confirm that the latest T3AA package is downloaded.
5. Confirm that AI Foundation (`EXT:ns_t3af`) is installed automatically or available after activation.

## Composer Installation

Use this workflow when your TYPO3 project is managed with Composer:

1. Check the T3Planet Composer repository configuration.
2. Update the `only` parameter so the project can download T3AA:

```json
"only": [
  "nitsan/ns-t3aa"
]
```

3. Install the T3AA package:

```bash
composer require nitsan/ns-t3aa
```

4. Verify that the installation completed successfully.
5. Confirm that AI Foundation (`nitsan/ns-t3af` / `EXT:ns_t3af`) is installed. If it is missing, install it using **Step 3 — Install AI Foundation**.

## Step 3 — Install AI Foundation

AI Foundation (`EXT:ns_t3af`) is required before T3AA can be used.
It provides the shared AI provider configuration, models, API access, logs, and service layer used by T3AA.

If AI Foundation was already installed in Step 2, you can skip to Step 4.

**AI Foundation** is the shared AI infrastructure for T3Planet AI Foundation extensions.
Complete the parent setup first, then continue with the remaining T3AA steps below.

AI Foundation is available from the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).

Download / TER page: https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/ns_t3af

## AI Foundation has two provider modes

In **AI Foundation → AI Providers**, choose how T3AA gets AI access:

**Your Own API Keys**

Use this mode when you want to connect your own AI vendor accounts. You store
and manage your API keys (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) in AI
Foundation and run AI features through those providers.

**AI Credits**

**AI Credits** is T3Planet’s managed AI access for AI Foundation. It lets
your TYPO3 site use AI features **without storing or managing your own vendor
API keys**.

**Link for AI Credits:** [AI Credits Documentation](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/T3Planet-Credit-System/Index)

## Option 1 — Extension Manager (TER)

1. Open **Admin Tools** → **Extensions**.
2. Select **Get Extensions**.
3. Search for `ns_t3af` or **AI Foundation**.
4. Install and activate the extension.
5. Flush all TYPO3 caches.

## Option 2 — Composer

If AI Foundation is not already present after installing T3AA, install it with:

```bash
composer require nitsan/ns-t3af
```

Then flush all TYPO3 caches.

- [AI Providers](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/Configuration/AIProviders/Index)
- [AI Credits](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AF/T3Planet-Credit-System/Index)

## Step 4 — Run Database Analyzer

After installing the extension, apply all pending database changes:

1. Open **Admin Tools**.
2. Go to **Maintenance**.
3. Open **Analyze Database Structure**.
4. Apply all pending database schema updates.

Run this before using T3AA modules in the TYPO3 backend.

## Step 5 — Configure AI Access

In **AI Foundation → AI Providers**, choose one mode:

**AI Credits (no API keys)**

1. Choose **AI Credits**.
2. Complete **Activate** if shown.

T3AA then sends all AI requests through T3Planet. You do not need your own API keys. In T3AA dialogs, **Select AI Provider** shows only **T3Planet Credits**.

**Your Own API Keys**

1. Choose **Your Own API Keys**.
2. Add your provider (for example OpenAI) and its API key.
3. Save the provider and model configuration.
4. Verify the AI connection with a test request.

T3AA AI features (alt text, simplified text, voiceover, Fix Hub AI Solution) do not work until one of these modes is set up. The Scanner does not need AI access.

For what uses credits and how the scan page quota differs from AI credits, see [Using T3AA with AI Credits](/ExtNsT3AA/Configuration/Index#using-t3aa-with-ai-credits).

## Step 6 — Verify the Installation

Before handing the system to editors, verify that:

- `EXT:ns_t3aa` is installed and active.
- `EXT:ns_t3af` is installed and active.
- The T3AA license is active.
- Database Analyzer changes are applied.
- AI Credits is active, or an AI provider is configured, in AI Foundation.
- TYPO3 caches are cleared.
- T3AA backend modules load without errors.

If all items above are true, installation is complete and you can start using T3AA.
