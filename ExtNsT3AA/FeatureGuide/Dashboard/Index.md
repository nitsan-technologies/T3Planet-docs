The **Dashboard** is the first tab in **AI Accessibility** (`EXT:ns_t3aa`).
It summarises accessibility status for the **page selected in the page tree**.

Opening the Dashboard does **not** call AI. Numbers come from stored scan
results and TYPO3 file metadata.

<div className="t3-embed"><iframe src="https://app.supademo.com/embed/cmu27amjl0g0nqmrxdjavphgz?embed_v=2&utm_source=embed" loading="lazy" title="T3AA Dashboard Demo" allow="clipboard-write; fullscreen" frameBorder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Everything on this screen reports for the **selected page path**.

<Note>
If **AI Accessibility** is missing from the module menu, check that
`EXT:ns_t3aa` and `EXT:ns_t3af` are installed, the T3AA license is active
for this domain, and caches are flushed.
</Note>

## Scan page quota

At the top of the Dashboard (and on the Scanner / Bulk Scans screens) you see
**Scan page quota**:

* **Pages scanned** — pages already counted against your license
* **Pages remaining** — pages you can still scan
* **Page limit** — total pages allowed by the current license (or
  **Unlimited**)

This quota is separate from your AI Credits balance. Scans never use AI
credits, and AI features never reduce the scan page quota. See
[Scan page quota and AI credits](/ExtNsT3AA/Configuration/Index#scan-page-quota-and-ai-credits).

## How it works when you run a scan

1. You select a page and a **depth** (this page only, 1–3 levels, or infinite).
2. You click **Run Accessibility Check** (or process queued Bulk Scans).
3. T3AA builds the list of pages in that scope.
4. **Each page that is scanned counts as one page** against the license quota.
5. When remaining pages reach **0**, further licensed scans are blocked until
   the license allows more pages (the UI shows a page-scan limit message).

So “per click” means: one click can scan **many** pages (depending on depth),
and **every page in that run** reduces **Pages remaining**. Check quota before
large depth scans.

## Scope and Rescan

* Shows how many pages the last scan covered, and when it ran.
* If nothing was scanned yet, you get a short empty-state hint.
* **Rescan now** opens the **Scanner** tab so you can run another check.

## Overview tiles

| Tile | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Open issues | Outstanding items on the Fix Hub board |
| Site rating | Percentage summary from the last Scanner run |
| Awaiting review | AI alt text drafts not yet approved |
| Lighthouse | Latest Lighthouse accessibility score for one URL |
| Pages in scan scope | Pages included in the last scan for the selected path |


## Recommended next step

The coloured callout is the Dashboard’s priority action for the current scope
(for example: run the first scan, work open issues, or generate alt text). The
button jumps to the matching workflow.

## What needs attention

A priority list of actionable items, for example:

* Serious / critical Scanner findings → **Open Issues**
* Images without alternative text → **Generate alt text**
* AI drafts waiting for approval → **Review**

Work top down. Items are ordered by impact.

## Where everything stands

Status cards for major areas (Scanner, AI Alt Text, Content, Widget, Expert
Audit). Click a card to open that tab.

## Charts and setup

* **Open issues over time** — finding counts across recent scans
* **By severity** / **By WCAG level** — breakdown from the last scan (not a
  legal conformance claim)
* **Setup health** — configuration checklist (AI provider, Scanner, Lighthouse
  key, Widget, and similar)
* **Recent activity** — completed or failed Scanner / Lighthouse runs

When setup is incomplete, an **AI Foundation Setup Checklist** may appear above
the content. Finish incomplete items before expecting **AI generation** features
to run.

## Important notes

* A valid T3AA license is required for the backend domain.
* Select a page in the page tree; empty selection means there is no scope.
* **AI generation** features (alt text, simplify text, audio, voiceover) need a
  working provider in **AI Foundation → AI Providers**, plus the matching
  options under **AI Foundation → AI Features**.
* A high Lighthouse score is a health indicator, not a WCAG conformance proof.
* Dashboard render itself does not call AI.
