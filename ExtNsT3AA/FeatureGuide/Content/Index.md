The **Content** tab lists accessibility content jobs for the **selected page**.
The audio, voiceover and simplify cards start the job. The Live Audit and
Filemeta cards open a walkthrough and point you to the place where the work is
done. Details are on the linked Feature Guide pages below.

## Live Audit

Scan CKEditor content for accessibility issues in real time with Editoria11y.
Same Live Audit as on the dashboard — open the walkthrough, or edit the selected
page in the Page module to run checks in CKEditor.

See [Accessibility Checker using T3AA](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/CkeditorAccessibilityChecker/Index).

## Filemeta

**Create AI Filemeta** opens a walkthrough for single-image metadata. The card
does not generate metadata itself. Generate it in **File List** (edit the image
metadata → **Generate file meta with T3AA**) or in **AI Alt Text**.

See [AI Alt Text](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/AIAltText/Index).

## AI Filemeta Bulk

**Create Bulk AI Filemeta** opens a walkthrough for bulk metadata. The card
does not start a bulk job. Start it in **File List** with **Mass AI Filemeta**,
or queue images in **AI Alt Text**.

See [AI Alt Text](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/AIAltText/Index) (bulk / Scheduler
and Mass AI Filemeta sections).

## Create audio from a script

Paste or upload a script and generate speech. Choose the provider and voice in
the flow. The provider is selected inside the modal, not on the card.

See [AI Audio](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/AIAudio/Index).

## Create a page voiceover

Pick a page and generate a narration of its content for visitors who prefer to
listen. The provider is selected inside the modal, not on the card.

See [AI Voiceover](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/AIVoiceover/Index).

## Simplify text into plain language

Rewrite page content into simpler language for readers with cognitive or reading
difficulties, or limited language proficiency. Runs in the TYPO3 Localize wizard
on the page module.

See [Simplified Text](/en/latest/ExtNsT3AA/FeatureGuide/SimplifiedText/Index).
